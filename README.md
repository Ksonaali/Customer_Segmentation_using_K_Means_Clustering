# Customer_Segmentation_using_K_Means_Clustering

Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This repository contains code for customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The aim is to group customers into distinct clusters based on their purchase history, demographics, and other relevant features.

The K-Means algorithm is implemented using scikit-learn and the resulting clusters are visualized using matplotlib. The dataset used in this project is not included in the repository, but can be easily substituted with any other suitable dataset.

Number of Clusters

The number of clusters chosen for this project is 5, labeled as clusters 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. The optimal number of clusters can be determined using techniques such as the elbow method or silhouette score analysis.

Usage

The main script, "customer_segmentation.py", contains code for loading and preprocessing the data, applying the K-Means algorithm, and visualizing the resulting clusters.

Requirements

The code requires the following packages:

scikit-learn
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
Credits

The dataset used in this project is the Online Retail dataset .
